[!DNL Recommendations] helps you optimize and customize real-time suggestions across channels, apps, pages, email messages, and other delivery options to increase engagement and conversion while reducing management effort.

[!DNL Recommendations] helps you:

* Create sophisticated criteria (rules) to automate recommendations 
* Automatically display the recommendations by using a few JavaScript snippets 
* Test and optimize the recommendations criteria and designs that display the recommendations 
* Report on the results of your recommendations activities

The following illustration shows recommendations on a web page:

A recommendation determines how a product is suggested to a customer, depending on that customer's activities on the site. For example:

| Desired Action | Recommendation |
|--- |--- |
|Encourage people who purchase a backpack to consider buying hiking shoes and trekking poles.|Create a recommendation that shows items that are often purchased together, using the "People who bought this also bought that" criteria.|
|Increase the time visitors spend on your media site by recommending media content similar to what they are watching.|Create a recommendation that suggests other videos, using the "People who viewed this viewed that" criteria.|
|Suggest that customers who viewed information about savings plans at your bank also read about IRA accounts.|Show other products people purchased after viewing one product without showing the first product in the recommendations, using the "people who viewed this also bought" criteria.|
</table>
